**2021 Master Thesis in Electrical Engineering** Hoboken, New Jersey _(February 2021 - May 2021)_<br>
**Objective:** Contactless vital signs measurement and analysis via FMCW radar<br>
**Laboratory:** [The Bio-Electromagnetics Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.tavassolian-lab.com/people)<br>
**Advisor:** Associate Prof. Negar Tavassolian [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=xTUFHmIAAAAJ)<br>
**Reader:** Prof. Lei Wu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BtMLsDIAAAAJ)
  - Application of ultra width frequency radar to detect human vital signs.
  - The wearable sensor shimmer3 GSR + and Apple Watch 3 are used as reference signals.
  - The phase extraction region is determined by range FFT, and then the phase is extracted by vibration FFT. Through DC removal, Hanning window and two band-pass filters, human respiration signal and heartbeat signal are extracted respectively.
  - After calculation and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis, 96.4% correlation (Apple watch 3 as reference signal) and 95.5% and 83.8% correlation (shimmer3 GSR + as reference signal) were achieved respectively.

**Laboratory:** [HPDA (High-Performance Data Analytics) Lab at Stevens Institute of Technology](https://web.stevens.edu/hpda/)<br>
**Supervisor:** Associate Prof. Hang Liu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=EbTnLekAAAAJ)<br>
**Position::** **Leader** of a 3-person team work
  - Most of the work was done on XSEDE cloud server which has a huge amount of GPU resources.
  - Used Shared Memory & Memory Coalesced methods to optimize matrix multiplication and matrix transpose.
  - The time to complete an epoch with shared memory optimization and non-optimization is 1.506s and 1.787s respectively.

**Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program** Changchun, China _(April 2016 - April 2017)_<br>
**Objective:** To design a non-contact palmar vein recognition instrument based on image processing<br>
**Supervisor:** Associate Prof. Shifeng Wang<br>
**Position::** **Leader** of a 3-person team work
  - Tried the methods of open-close operation, Gaussian filtering, NiBlack local binarization, adaptive thresh- old, dilation and erosion to perfectly show palmar vein image.
  - Used ORB test method to extract the key points of two images that need to be matched.
  - Utilized a mathematical method RANSAC for eliminating mismatched points.
