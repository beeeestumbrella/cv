## üßëüèª‚Äçüî¨ Research Experience
**2021 UPS Project** Mahwah, New Jersey _(June 2021 - Present)_<br>
**Objective:** Address Proximity
  - Profile UPS customers and find relationship between UPS Access Point and a large amount of Delivery Location Point
  - It is a data mining and clustering exercise on UPS delivery data.
  - The goal is to be able to recommend an alternative delivery location to UPS customers.
  - Business values include transportation cost saving, improve delivery density and new business opportunities with local partners.

**2021 Master Thesis in Electrical Engineering** Hoboken, New Jersey _(February 2021 - May 2021)_<br>
**Objective:** Contactless vital signs measurement and analysis via FMCW radar<br>
**Laboratory:** [The Bio-Electromagnetics Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.tavassolian-lab.com/people)<br>
**Advisor:** Associate Prof. Negar Tavassolian [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=xTUFHmIAAAAJ)<br>
**Reader:** Prof. Lei Wu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BtMLsDIAAAAJ)
  - Application of implementing Ultra-Wide Bandwidth Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (UWB-FMCW) radar to detect human vital signs.
  - The wearable sensor shimmer3 GSR + and Apple Watch 3 were used as reference signals.
  - The phase extraction region is determined by range FFT, and then the phase is extracted by vibration FFT. Through DC removal, Hanning window and two band-pass filters, human respiration signal and heartbeat signal were extracted respectively.
  - After calculation and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis, 96.4% correlation (Apple watch 3 as reference signal) and 95.5% and 83.8% correlation (shimmer3 GSR + as reference signal) were achieved respectively.

**Laboratory:** [HPDA (High-Performance Data Analytics) Lab at Stevens Institute of Technology](https://web.stevens.edu/hpda/)<br>
**Supervisor:** Associate Prof. Hang Liu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=EbTnLekAAAAJ)<br>
**Position:** **Leader** of a 3-person team work
  - Most of the work was done on XSEDE cloud server which has a huge amount of GPU resources.
  - Used Shared Memory & Memory Coalesced methods to optimize matrix multiplication and matrix transpose.
  - The time to complete an epoch with shared memory optimization and non-optimization is 1.506s and 1.787s respectively.
