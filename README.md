## üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ Research Projects at UMICH
**Master's Thesis for M.S. in Environment and Sustainability** - Ann Arbor, MI _(June 2022 - Present)_<br>
- Supervised by Dr. Sara Hughes<br>
- Investigate why some cities are more successful than others in implementing equity promises of climate action plans in California through addressing: (1) have cities that include equity promises in their climate plans developed strong implementation strategies to implement those promises/actions; (2) what is the actual implementation status of the equity promises/actions addressed in the plan; (3) is there a match between the strength of implementation strategies and implementation status; and (4) what are the implementation opportunities and challenges do cities face 
- Primary methods include data collection, content analysis, qualitative comparative analysis, evaluation metric development, interviews, policy evaluation, and statistical analysis (if necessary)
- Plan to be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in April 2024

  -  Collaborated closely with community partners (local resilience hubs, City of Detroit, etc.) on the east side of Detroit as part of the Resilience Eastside Initiatives (REI) to create a climate emergency definition framework with detailed triggers and response mechanisms for different tiers of climate emergency warning
    - Created location-based framework and targeted vulnerable populations for early notifications for four common natural disasters - extreme heat, flooding, winter storms, and air quality
    - Conducted interviews with local resilience hub leaders to understand their existing operational mechanisms and their needs to be incorporated into the framework
- Created a map of active resilience hubs distribution on the east side of Detroit and major greenspace areas as a resource for residents to locate the nearest resilience hubs for help before, during, and after major disasters (my individual work using ArcGIS and Photoshop)
- Deliverables include (1) a one-pager of educational materials and summary of key findings and opportunities on the results of climate plans evaluation for Elevate to get involved; (2) individual one-pager for each type of emergency (descriptions of definitions and a flow chart on directing resilience hubs to react); (3) resilience hub network map; (4) final report (will be published) summarizing the project, including methods, deliverables, impacts, and future research considerations; (5) presentations to community partners at the 4th REI roundtable and to fellowship partnerships, U-M professors, and stakeholders at the Dow Sustainability Fellowship Symposium in December

**Data Visualization Project - How the air quality improves with the strict air pollution regulations in place in
California and how climate justice has been upheld in terms of air quality improvement in the past 10 years?** - Ann Arbor, MI _(January 2023 - April 2023)_<br>
- Utilized data on California‚Äôs Air Quality Statistics and Indexes by CBSA location collected from EPA to visualize (in R):
  - (1) How has the air quality changed in the past 10 years (2012-2011) in California?
  - (2) How has the air quality in climate-disadvantaged communities changed compared with non-disadvantaged communities in past 10 years (2012-2011) in California?
- Created time-series and spatial visualizations using factors including Ozone, PM 2.5, CO, # of good quality days, # of unhealthy quality days
- Concluded:
  - (1) There has been no obvious trend of spatial changes in air quality across the states in the past 10 years.
  - (2) Overall, the air quality has improved in the past 10 years across the state, with some fluctuations.
  - (3) The comparison between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities shows the ineffectiveness of the climate justice slogan advocated by the state government.
