## üë©üèª‚Äçüî¨ Research Projects at UMICH
**Master's Thesis for M.S. in Environment and Sustainability** - Ann Arbor, MI _(June 2022 - Present)_<br>
**Supervised by Dr. Sara Hughes
**Objective:** Address Proximity
  - Profile UPS customers and find relationship between UPS Access Point and a large amount of Delivery Location Point
  - It is a data mining and clustering exercise on UPS delivery data.
  - The goal is to be able to recommend an alternative delivery location to UPS customers.
  - Business values include transportation cost saving, improve delivery density and new business opportunities with local partners.
<br><br>

**2023 Dow Sustainability Fellowship Project (team of 4)** - Ann Arbor, MI _(Janurary 2022 - Present)_<br>
**Objective:** Aggressive driver behavior analysis
  - Trained LSTM and Random Forest Model with public sensor data
  - Completed training work on Google Cloud Platform
  - The trained models were returned to Flask server then returned aggressive/non-aggressive events to HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard.
  - Designed a web-based dashboard to display our analysis and further expansion

**Innovation for Impact: Climate Change** - Ann Arbor, MI _(August 2022 - December 2022)_<br>
**Objective:** Contactless vital signs measurement and analysis via FMCW radar<br>
**Laboratory:** [The Bio-Electromagnetics Laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.tavassolian-lab.com/people)<br>
**Advisor:** Associate Prof. Negar Tavassolian [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=xTUFHmIAAAAJ)<br>
**Reader:** Prof. Lei Wu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BtMLsDIAAAAJ)
  - Application of implementing Ultra-Wide Bandwidth Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (UWB-FMCW) radar to detect human vital signs.
  - The wearable sensor shimmer3 GSR + and Apple Watch 3 were used as reference signals.
  - The phase extraction region is determined by range FFT, and then the phase is extracted by vibration FFT. Through DC removal, Hanning window and two band-pass filters, human respiration signal and heartbeat signal were extracted respectively.
  - After calculation and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis, 96.4% correlation (Apple watch 3 as reference signal) and 95.5% and 83.8% correlation (shimmer3 GSR + as reference signal) were achieved respectively.

**Research Fellow Projects: [Supporting Environmental Friendly Mining Legislation in Michigan](https://practicalpolicy.umich.edu/research-projects/supporting-environmentally-friendly-mining-legislation-michigan)** - Ann Arbor, MI _(Janurary 2022 - May 2022)_<br>
**Objective:** Implementing and accelerating Transformer and BERT by using CUDA C/C++<br>
**Laboratory:** [HPDA (High-Performance Data Analytics) Lab at Stevens Institute of Technology](https://web.stevens.edu/hpda/)<br>
**Supervisor:** Associate Prof. Hang Liu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=EbTnLekAAAAJ)<br>
**Position:** **Leader** of a 3-person team work
  - Most of the work was done on XSEDE cloud server which has a huge amount of GPU resources.
  - Used Shared Memory & Memory Coalesced methods to optimize matrix multiplication and matrix transpose.
  - The time to complete an epoch with shared memory optimization and non-optimization is 1.506s and 1.787s respectively.

**Water Policy & Politics: Climate Change and Threats to National Flood Insurance Program Affordability ** - Ann Arbor, MI _(Janurary 2022 - May 2022)_<br>
**Objective:** To design a non-contact palmar vein recognition instrument based on image processing<br>
**Supervisor:** Associate Prof. Shifeng Wang<br>
**Position:** **Leader** of a 3-person team work
  - Tried the methods of open-close operation, Gaussian filtering, NiBlack local binarization, adaptive thresh- old, dilation and erosion to perfectly show palmar vein image.
  - Used ORB test method to extract the key points of two images that need to be matched.
  - Utilized a mathematical method RANSAC for eliminating mismatched points.

**Public Land Management** Davis, CA _(Septemer 2019 - December 2019)_<br>
**Objective:** To implement vortex beams based on LCOS-SLM, then propose a new method producing vector vortex beams based on LCOS-SLM.<br>
**Supervisor:** Prof. Zhiying Liu<br>
**Position:** **Leader** of a 3-person team work, but **the only one** sticked to the end.
  - Adopted computer numerical simulation to compute the interference of object beam and reference beam.
  - Got vortex beam and optimized index properties by Combining the algorithm principle of CGH and LCOS-SLM.
  - Got Interferometric hologram.
